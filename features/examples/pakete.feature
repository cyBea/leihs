Feature: Create model with packages

  Background:
    Given I am Mike
    And I open the inventory

  @javascript @browser @personas
  Scenario: Create model with package assignments
    When I add a new Model
    And I fill in at least the required fields
    And I add one or more packages
    And I add one or more items to this package
    And I save both package and model
    Then the model is created and the packages and their assigned items are saved
    And the packages have their own inventory codes

  @javascript @browser @personas
  Scenario: A model that already has items cannot be turned into a package
    When I edit a model that already has items

    Then I cannot assign packages to that model

  @javascript @browser @personas
  Scenario: Can't create package without items
    When I add a package to a model
    Then I can only save this package if I also assign items

  @javascript @browser @personas
  Scenario: Remove single item from a package
    When I edit a package
    Then I can remove items from the package
    And those items are no longer assigned to the package
