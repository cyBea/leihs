Feature: Basic information for inventory pools

  As a person responsible for managing inventory pools
  I want to be able to change their settings and supply basic information
  So that each inventory pool has all the information and settings they
  need to work efficiently (e.g. opening hours, proper addresses, etc.)

  @javascript @personas
  Scenario: Make basic settings
    Given I am Mike
    When I navigate to the inventory pool section in the admin area
    Then I enter the inventory pool's basic settings as follows:
    | Name |
    | Short Name |
    | E-Mail |
    | Description |
    | Default Contract Note|
    | Print Contracts |
    | Automatic access |
    And I make a note of which page I'm on
    And I save
    Then I see a confirmation that the information was saved
    And the settings are updated
    And I am still on the same page

    And I save
    Then I see an error message

    Then the newly created user has 'customer'-level access to all inventory pools that grant automatic access, but not to mine
    And in my inventory pool the user gets the role 'inventory manager'
