Dear {{ user.name }},

** This is an automatically generated response **

Your order for the following items has been confirmed by the inventory manager, but a few changes were made to it:

Inventory pool: {{ inventory_pool.name }}

{% for h in histories %}

    {{ h.text }}
{% endfor %}

The order now looks like this:

{% for l in order_lines %}
* {{ l.quantity }} {{ l.model_name }}, {{ l.start_date | date: '%d/%m/%Y' }} - {{ l.end_date | date: '%d/%m/%Y' }}
{% endfor %}

{% if comment %}

These are the comments of the inventory manager:

{{ comment }}

{% endif %}

Kind regards,

{{ email_signature }}
